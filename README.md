# Explanation:

At the start creating a folder and adding file ot the folder using touch command and after that type the content in the file then add it using git add command after that commit the file
After commiting the file creating a new branch as 'feature/update-styling' after adding the branch  modify the content in the file which we created and then add the file and then again use commit command to change the commit changes
After commit switch the branch to the master and create new branch as fetaure/add-content and again add the file and commit 
After completion second branch add origin of the github respoistory and again push to the origin master 
git push -u origin feature/update-styling
git push -u origin fetaure/add-content
And after that clone the github repository and then i have compare the both the pull requets occur from the commit changes that done in git 
For feature/update-styling ,fetaure/add-content  we should compare the pull request 
After completion of pull request we need to merge the requests and after that the content in the file has changed 
So that changed file we can access in both the git and github respository
I used to change the conflicts in the github repository in the file changed section in the github
Then after adding the screenshots  to the readme file then we can commit the changes.

# husky
# what i have understood about husky
Husky is a npm tool for the javascript projects that automates the git . And also we can say that Husky manages our git hooks by running commands before a commit or push.and the husky can create the directory as that can create in the json file . we can install the husky and after installing we should use a command npx husky install so that it will create a husky folder. And husky can do the commit messages checks.
